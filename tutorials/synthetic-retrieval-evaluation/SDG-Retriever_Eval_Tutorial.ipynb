    "\n",
    "Before we start generating the data, let's align on the larger process - To evaluate a retriever, you need two things, questions & the ground truth. From a synthetic data perspective we are flipping the problem on its head. We can start with a few documents, create chunks and then create questions that can be answered using those chunks. In this manner, we already know the chunks for each question and can create the evaluation pairs. If you want to learn more about naunces of evaluating retrieval pipelines, please do check out [this article](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/evaluating-retriever-for-enterprise-grade-rag/).\n",

However, this is balanced by a broad and deep understanding of the general topic, allowing them to contextualize their analysis within the wider field. Their writing is likely to be dense with concepts and ideas, though the presentation may be somewhat abstract or high-level, reflecting their focus on overall strategies rather than minute specifics. Overall, Joan's writing is geared towards an audience already familiar with financial and econometric principles, and is aimed at conveying strategic insights rather than detailed data analysis.

       "   'style': \"Aaron's writing style is characterized by a lack of depth and analysis, often skimming the surface of the topic without delving into the underlying complexities. His sentences are likely to be short and simple, reflecting his limited proficiency in the English language. He tends to rely on basic vocabulary and avoids nuanced expressions, which can result in a somewhat flat and unengaging tone. Furthermore, Aaron has a tendency to sensationalize his stories, often using attention-grabbing headlines and exaggerated language to make his points seem more compelling than they actually are. This can lead to a 'clickbait' style of writing, where the focus is on attracting readers rather than providing a thoughtful and balanced exploration of the topic. Overall, Aaron's writing is likely to be straightforward, simplistic, and attention-seeking, with a focus on surface-level details rather than in-depth analysis or insight.\"},\n",

    "**Takeaway-** The pipeline above is an illustration of how one could go about using a LLM powerful LLM and an embedding model to generate synthetic data for evaluating retriever pipeline. It is not *the* pipeline that will solve all your synthetic data needs, but rather is a good starting point to stimulate thinking around synthesizing data to address your data needs.\n",

    "* Basic building blocks like LLM as a judge can be used to create more filters. It is recommended to design more filters that are in line with your data. Additionally Reward Models can also be used as judges to add more types of filters.\n",
    "* Frameworks like [Self-Discover](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03620) can be used to improve the reasoning/critic capabilities for the LLM to adapt to the complextity of the underlying data\n",
    "* More experimentations with personas can be done to further extract behavioural information for further targeting specific types of questions.\n",
    "* This pipeline can be scaled up to generate triplets for finetuning your embedding model. This scaled up pipeline can be encorporated into an Ops pipeline to do automatic finetuning to continously improve you RAG pipelines."
